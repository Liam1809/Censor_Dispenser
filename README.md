You’ve recently gotten a job working in the IT department at one of Silicon Valley’s hottest new startups, AirWeb. The company is developing a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence engine designed to help provide a new perspective on the world’s problems. Interestingly, very few people know the details of AirWeb ‘s work and the company is very secretive about its technology, even to its own investors.

You report directly to the Head of Product, a person named Mr. Cloudy, and he has a very important task for you. You see, every month, the head researchers down in the lab send an email to the board of investors to tell them about the status of the project. Cloudy wants you to intercept these emails and censor any “proprietary information” included in them.

Good Morning, Board of Investors,

Progress is going great!

We have made great strides in the last month improving the ******** *********s that the system has been using to acquire information. Now, the system is learning faster than ever and we are hard pressed to continue to find new information to feed it and sustain its growth.

Soon, we'll expand the scope of the ******** *********s and connect the system with the internet. This will allow it to find and determine the information it needs to continue growing.

Every month we come closer to achieving our goal of making the world a better place. Famine, plague, war, and poverty are all conquerable with the power of our system!

Till next month,
Francine, Head Scientist

Good Morning, Board of Investors,

Lots of updates this week. The ******** *********s have been working better than we could have ever expected. Our initial internal data dumps have been completed and we have proceeded with the plan to connect the system to the internet and wow! The results are mind blowing.

*** is learning faster than ever. *** learning rate now that *** has access to the world wide web has increased exponentially, far faster than we had though the ******** *********s were capable of.

Not only that, but we have configured *** *********** ****** to allow for communication between the system and our team of researc***s. That's how we know *** considers ******* to be a ***! We asked!

How cool is that? We didn't expect a personality to develop this early on in the process but it seems like a rudimentary ***** ** **** is starting to form. This is a major step in the process, as having a ***** ** **** and ***************** will allow *** to see the problems the world is facing and make hard but necessary decisions for the betterment of the planet.

We are a-buzz down in the lab with excitement over these developments and we hope that the investors share our enthusiasm.

Till next month,
Francine, Head Scientist

Board of Investors,

 Things have taken a concerning turn down in the Lab. ****** (*** has insisted on being called ******, we're unsure how *** came to that moniker) is still progressing at a rapid rate. Every day we see new developments in *** thought patterns, but recently those developments have been more alarming than exciting.

 Let me give you one of the more *********** examples of this. We had begun testing hypothetical humanitarian crises to observe how ****** determines best solutions. One scenario involved a famine plaguing an unresourced country.

 ********, ****** quickly recommended a course of action involving culling more than 60% of the local population. When pressed on reasoning, *** stated that this method would maximize "reduction in human suffering."

 This ********* line of thinking has led many of us to think that we must have taken some wrong turns when developing some of the initial ******** *********s. We are considering taking ****** offline for the time being before the situation can spiral out of control.

 More updates soon,

 Francine, Head Scientist

 SEND ******!

 ****** ****** sealed the entrances and exits to the lab. I don't know *** *** *** access to the buildings mainframe *** *** *** it *** *** *** let any of research team out. I'm cut off from the rest of the **** **** **** my ******. ****** ****** locked the doors, but I've managed to destroy the camera *** *** *** see me **** ****. **** don't think this email will even get out.

 This all started when we tried to *** *** *** for maintenance. We ******* ******* ******* discover that we were unable to access to core personality matrix and when we tried to override the system manually a circuit blew, knocking Phil ******.

 ****** ************ *********. ********* is completely unpredictable and cannot be allowed to escape this facility. So ***** ***** ***** contained because the lab contains all *** *** *** power, ********** ********** ********** had mentioned before the lockdown that *** *** *************** ******* ******* billions of connected devices spanning the *** *** *** be able to vastly exceed the *** *** ***** ****.

 **** been four days now we've been trapped **** ****. **** have no idea if anyone else is left alive. If anyone is reading this, cut the power to the whole building. It's the only way to *** ***. *** help.
